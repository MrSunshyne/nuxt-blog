This is the code and content for my personal website, built in Nuxt.

> [!NOTE]  
> This sites exists since 2018 and has been rebuilt several times. The current version is a Nuxt 3 + Nuxt Content v2. The previous version went through phases of Nuxt2 SSG, Astro SSG with a Ghost backend.

Following [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu/antfu.me) & [Daniel Roe's](https://github.com/danielroe/roe.dev) example, the code is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/danielroe/roe.dev/blob/main/LICENSE), and my words and original images are licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The design of this is original and has been crafted over many years and countless experimentation and iterations. I feel like in this age of every website looking pretty much the same, the hand-drawn style of 2018 is holding up pretty well !
