After 2 months of break, and an amazing last meetup on the beach, the first frontend.mu meetup of 2024 finally happened. We had to postpone it because of the cyclone last week, which means the Feb meetup actually happened in March.

## Planning

Due to the postponing, there were a lot of communications to be done behind the scenes to inform everyone and make sure nobody leaves home unnecessarily. Kushul used our handy custom messaging script to ping everyone and checked for confirmation.

## Arriving at SD Worx

I left home slightly later than I would have preferred, but managed to reach around 9.45am. When writing in the logbook at the entrace, i saw there were already a lot of people who joined, which was super encouraging! I joined everyone and started unpacking my laptop and keyboards. Yes Keyboards !

## The Keyboard Corner

As previously announced, we wanted to invite everyone who have nice keyboards to bring it to the event so that we could have a fun moment among nerds. In Mauritius, we never get to try multiple types of keyboards or switches at the same location. All the shops that sell keyboards do not let you try it before buying. This was a unique opportunity and it was so much fun !

## Logistics

SDWorx had a really nice setup with a big projector screen, more than 50 seats and even microphones and loudspeakers for the presenters. Yes please !

## Meetup RSVPs

The past few weeks a few of us have been working hard to build an RSVP system that we can use for frontend  coders meetup. It's all open source and on our github. We merge an "attendance/verification" feature the previous night and it allows someone from the organizing team to scan a qr code from attendees, and "mark them as verified". This means they get a badge on the account and it's trusted that they really attended the event !

Cedric was our designated Admin for the day, and he scanned the tickets of the attendees while we were getting ready to start.

## The Meetup

At around 10.30 it was time to kick off the event, and as it is customary, I greented everyone and introduced frontend.mu and our mission statement.

Didier from SD Worx then addressed the audience and introduced the company and what they do.

Then I took over again and summarized the community updates from the past few months so that everyone can get a sense that we try to involve as many people as possible in the meetups and anyone can participate.
