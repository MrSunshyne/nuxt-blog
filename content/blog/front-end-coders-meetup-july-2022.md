I reached around 9.30am to grab some soft drinks and pain au chocolats at Intermart for the attendees before heading to the venue. We waited for the attendees to be seated and the meetup started at around 10.20AM

## Intro Session

This time I didn't have any session to present, which gave me more time to prepare the slides for the intro segment. I used [this template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/837094269982519505) from Figma and customized it a little to suit front-end coders. As usual, I explained who are the front-end coders and why we host meetups, thank the sponsor, introduce the speakers, suggest the topic for next month's meetup. I also left just one slide of CSS tips, since I'm not presenting anything else today.

## Topic 1 : Percy Mamedy - Modern monolith with Laravel & InertiaJs

[Percy](https://twitter.com/PercyMamedy) gave a great tour of InertiaJS and how it works. He built a simple frontend + backend to-do application which communicates via axios API calls, then he proceeded to refactor the application live in front of the audience to make it become an IntertiaJS app with Laravel + Vue.

Percy explains IntertiaJS

Honestly, I thought this was a very good approach to build web apps that are already using Laravel and want to have better integration with their frontends. Will definitely use it in the future. Percy described IntertiaJS as an alternative routing library for Vue, which instantly helps clarify the technology.

## Topic 2: **Ish Sookun** - Laravel Livewire

[Ish](https://twitter.com/IshSookun) was next and he also gave a live demo using a light theme on Livewire. He made a good looking application that lists names in a data table, and show how he was able to add pagination and search very easily while not writing much (if any) JavaScript.

Ish speaks about Livewire

The simplicity of the tech works was quite impressive. Livewire appears to be inspired from Hotwire. aka HTML over the Wire.

## Lunch

Lots of pizzas!

We took a lunch break and had panarotti pizzas, and took the time to network a bit. It was a fun and jovial ambiance. We had a group photo right after lunch

Ravish demoing Laravel Breeze

Up next, Ravish showed a demo of how to make a Laravel app talk to NextJS using breeze. It was really a breeze how easy and fast it was to set up.

## Topic 4 : **Yusuf Abdool Satar** (Gophers.mu) - How to structure a go program

For the final presentation, [Yusuf](https://twitter.com/__fluxy__) from [Gophers.mu](https://gophers.mu/) shared his experience about structuring Go programs and the reasoning behind his proposed structure.

Yusuf speaks about his experience with Go

I thought it was very enlightening, even if I don't write go myself. His structure is inspired by the Go Standard library.
