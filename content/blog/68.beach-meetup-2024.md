# The Beach Meetup 2024

## Planning

Making this day happen took a lot of planning, effort and support from a lot of people, without which it would have been impossible. After last year's successful event we wanted to make it a tradition to host an outdoor tech event, in a very relaxed setting. As we do for all the meetups, we went to scout the location in advance to make sure it's safe and appropriate for the event. After trying to find a beach with the necessary criteria, we ended up going back to the same spot as last year.

If that's interesting to you, these were my criterias:

- Proximity to the beach
- Trees to provide shade
- Large enough grass area for the event
- Public space
- Large enough so that we don't disturb others and others don't disturb us
- Likeliness of good weather
- Not too windy as we need to hear people speak

If you know of other spots that match this description, PLEASE let me know !
