# The Beach Meetup 2024

## Planning

Making this day happen took a lot of planning, effort and support from a lot of people, without which it would have been impossible. After last year's successful event we wanted to make it a tradition to host an outdoor tech event, in a very relaxed setting. As we do for all the meetups, we went to scout the location in advance to make sure it's safe and appropriate for the event. After trying to find a beach with the necessary criteria, we ended up going back to the same spot as last year.

If that's interesting to you, these were my criterias:

- Proximity to the beach
- Trees to provide shade
- Large enough grass area for the event
- Public space
- Large enough so that we don't disturb others and others don't disturb us
- Likeliness of good weather
- Not too windy as we need to hear people speak

If you know of other spots that match this description, PLEASE let me know !

### Carpooling

Because no buses can reach this location, we ask attendees to disclose if they need a ride during the RSVP process. Using this information, we then coordinated with the drivers and non-drivers to make sure everyone could get a ride to the location and be on time. Huge thanks to everyone who were kind enough to take one or two passengers. üôè

### Using Vroume

This project is made for carpooling and events. We've been talking to the founder, Mervyn since months about using this as an option to coordinate the event rides and some people managed to use it. That was very cool. I hope this project takes off.

## Our Sponsors

Kushul and the team at Klanik spoke of this event a few months in advance and we were very happy that agreed to sponsor us! Many thanks to Tejas and Rachel who got us really tasty food for the day. We deeply appreciate a company that tries to support a community effort and we can see how they're trying to get people more interested into tech as career by making the job super interesting with a chill work environment.

## The event

## La Cambuse Public Beach

Mervyn was first at the spot and then the team from Grand Bay joined him. I arrived shortly after. I noticed Alex and Delphine were already there. The sun was shining as bright as you could imagine, what a hot day !

We carried all our stuff to the meetup spot which was about 5-6 minutes long minutes walk from the parking location. People joined us every minute and it was soon quite a crowd. We setup the tables, laptops while people passing by got curious about what's happening here. We distributed some litchis, mango salads and food coupons to everyone before kicking off the event.

## Intro

As usual, i explained the goal of the community to our attendees and introduced our sponsor and speakers for the day.
