Publicis Groupe welcomed the frontend.mu usergroup in their offices for the April meetup. The meetup was a great success with a good turnout and interesting talks.

## Intro

As usual I started the event with a brief introduction about frontend.mu and our mission statement. I then invited Vishwadev from Publicis Groupe to give a brief introduction about the company and what they do.

Some people who I had not met in a while were present, and it was great to see them again.

### A journey with microprocessors - Anand Ramrooch

Anand Ramrooch, first time speaker at frontend.mu shared his journey with the audience and elaborated on the evolution of microprocessors, starting from the very early days ! There was a lot of questions and we learned a lot from him.

### Concept AI tool to help manual testing - Ruben Pillay Vurdapen & Farhanaaz Curumthaullee

Ruben and Farhanaaz from Publicis shared with the audience a concept AI tool that they are working on to help manual testing. They explained how they are using AI to help testers and developers to automate some of the manual testing tasks. It was quite impressive to see how they are using AI to help improve the testing process. The live demo was a success and the audience was very impressed.

### Code and Honey - Jordan Bienvenue

Jordan was up next and as always, he came up with a unique presentation style which was a big hit. It was one of the most interactive sessions we've had at our meetups and he poked the audience about what they think of building products for the local market, and what would work work and why. Everyone was engaged and it was a great session. We're looking forward to his top secret project.

### Hacking with Zed, The New Code Editor - Bernard Joseph Jean Bruno

I first noticed that Bernard mentioned using zed and even wrote a plugin for it on his social media posts. Since I had introduced Zed in the previous meetup, this was the perfect follow up. Bernard spoke about LSPs and how to write this weird language in order to make our code editors sprinkle colors in just the right places so that us humans can make sense of the code we are reading. Of course, this is just a metaphore, but it was really cool to see his Blade plugin for syntax highlighting in Zed. He also shared how team members of Zed Industries reached out to him to help him improve his plugin. So cool! 

### Frontend News & Updates - Sandeep Ramgolam

This time I had a lot of news to share with the audience. I spoke about the latest updates in the frontend world and shared some interesting articles that I had read. I also shared some updates about the upcoming frontend.mu conference and how we are planning to make it a unique, content-focussed event. I also shared some updates about the frontend.mu website and how we are planning to improve it.

### Q&A session - Cedric Poilly

Cedric Poilly, our designated quiz master for the day, hosted a Quiz session with the audience. He used the new quiz app that he built on stream and we had a lot of fun. The winners got some cool prizes and everyone had a great time. 

## Conclusion

The meetup was a great success and we had a lot of fun. We are looking forward to the next meetup and we hope to see you there. If you would like to speak at one of our meetups, please reach out to us. We are always looking for new speakers and new topics to discuss.
