This blog itself is an experiment. There is no server/api running on the cloud that it gets the data from. The entire site is pre-rendered with the content built-in and then hosted on gitlab pages. A blogpost is coming soon to explain how it works.

Here's a list of the wonderful open source tools that helped

**Front-end Framework** : [Nuxt.js](http://nuxtjs.org/)

**Headless CMS :** [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) (hosted on my local machine)

**Blog Theme :** Custom \- Blog pages are heavily inspired by the amazing [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme from Ghost.

**CSS Utility Framework :** [Tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/batch-image-resizer)

**Deployment Pipelines & Hosting :** [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)

**Thumbnails & Reponsive Images generation :** [Batch Image Resizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/batch-image-resizer)

Total cost of running this website: $0, some energy and time.
